DONE:
- setup project by run npm init
- add pm/history.txt for project management purpose

- setup git and add first commit

- add eslint and config

- connected to mlab database
note about mongodb://<dbuser>:<dbpassword>@ds261138.mlab.com:61138/amazonclone
here *dbuser* need to be created on user tab on selected db, 
this is not *account* used to login to mlab itself.

- Schema.pre must has a function style cb not arrow function because 
of fat arrow lexically binds the function to current scope so *this*
will not be *Schema* instance
