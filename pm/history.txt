DONE:

- connected to mlab database
note about mongodb://<dbuser>:<dbpassword>@ds261138.mlab.com:61138/amazonclone
here *dbuser* need to be created on user tab on selected db, 
this is not *account* used to login to mlab itself.

- Schema.pre must has a function style cb not arrow function because 
of fat arrow lexically binds the function to current scope so *this*
will not be *Schema* instance

-// cookie-parser, express-session, express-flash
- both cookie and session are place to store data
- cookie store data on client side, thus can be accessed by user
  - cookie is sent by browser to server each request
  - cookie-parser is used to parser that cookie
- session store data on server side, thus cannot be accessed by user
  - server identify user using a session id (session.sid)
  - session.sid is stored in cookie (signed or unsinged)
  - because cookie is sent by browser to server each request, 
  server will get session.sid from cookie to identify user from session
  - express-session is used to handle above steps
- flash using exppres-session to pass message from route to route
